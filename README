LemonPOS is an open source Point of Sale software targeted for micro, small and medium businesses.
MySQL is employed for data management and storage, and can be used a single database with
many POS terminals on a network.
Being Linux or any other unix the target operating system, your information is safer against
virus attacks, and lowers the costs in licenses.

Lemon provides a modern themeable and easy to use Interface, a search panel, a price-checker tool,
an administration tool for managing your store, printed reports, and more...

It has beeen tested with a parallel matrix printer (Star Micronics SP500), an USB thermal printer
(Star Micronics TSP143), and an USB barcode reader (Dataogic DLC6065-M0).
